# Note Taker
A simple application to keep track of your notes.

Objectives:
- When I open the Note Taker, then I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
- When I click on the link to the notes page, then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- When I enter a new note title and the note’s text, then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
- When I click on the Save icon, then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
- When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column
- When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- When I click on the trash can icon next to an existing note, then that note is deleted from the application
